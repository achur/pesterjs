voice.js API
============

## Callbacks
Unless otherwise specified, all callbacks are of the following form: Function( error, response, data )

* error: an instance of GoogleVoiceError, containing a `code`, `message`, and optionally `details`
* response: the response object from the require module, containing information about the http request and response
* data: The returned data. Most often an object, unless it was impossible to parse the response. This is usually the page body when the http status code is 500. This is binary audio data for audio requests.

All callbacks are optional.


## Initialization
#### client = new voicejs.Client({email: email, password: password, tokens: tokens})
Returns a new voice client instance.

* email: String, required - The GV email address
* password: String, required - The GV password
* tokens: Object, optional - An object containing authentication tokens. Can have the following properties:
	* auth: String, optional
	* rnr: String, optional
	* gvx: String, optional


## Authentication tokens
voice.js uses three different authentication tokens when communicating with the Google Voice service, as discussed in 'TOKENS'. Not every token is needed for every request. voice.js will know which token is needed and will make sure it gets it before the request. If a request fails, voice.js will try obtaining a new token and repeating the request once before returning an error.

Three token-retrieval methods are provided if you want to retrieve the tokens yourself.

#### client.getTokens()
Returns an object containing the current authentication tokens.

#### client.auth( function(error, token){} )
Retrieves the 'auth' authentication token.

#### client.rnr( function(error, token){} )
Retrieves the 'rnr' authentication token.
	
#### client.gvx( function(error, token){} )
Retrieves the 'gvx' authentication token.
